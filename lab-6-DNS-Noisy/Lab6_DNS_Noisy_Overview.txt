Lab 6 â€” DNS Noisy/Exfil Simulation

Overview: Simulate and detect noisy/random DNS queries on the network.

Tools / Environment: Windows 11, Wireshark

Example DNS queries seen: abcd1234.yourdomain.test

Capture filter used: host 192.168.8.100 and port 53
Display filter used: dns

Conclusion: Captured noisy DNS queries on Windows 11 with Wireshark; shows how to detect unusual DNS patterns.

purpose:  This lab helped me practice capturing and analyzing DNS traffic using Wireshark, applying filters, and spotting unusual or random DNS queries. It builds foundational skills for monitoring network traffic in a SOC environment
