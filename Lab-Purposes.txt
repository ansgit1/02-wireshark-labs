Baseline browsing
Example: Employee opens YouTube — DNS lookup, TLS 1.3 handshake or QUIC over UDP/443, then steady video traffic.
SOC takeaway: Know normal domains, protocols (QUIC vs TCP), and typical byte patterns to spot deviations.

Follow a single conversation
Example: Isolate tcp.stream eq 5 showing GET /api/user → 200 OK with JSON payload.
SOC takeaway: You can see full request/response metadata and payload to confirm legitimate vs malicious data transfers.

Simulated credential leak (cleartext POST)
Example: User logs into http://insecure.example/login → POST body contains username=alice&password=1234 in cleartext.
SOC takeaway: Cleartext POSTs expose creds — alert on HTTP POSTs to external/unexpected hosts.

SYN scan (nmap -sS)
Example: One IP sends hundreds of SYNs to many ports on a server, few or no ACKs follow.
SOC takeaway: Many SYNs → likely reconnaissance; flag sources with high SYN-to-complete ratios.

SMB / RDP detection
Example: Host A connects to Host B on TCP/445 (SMB) or TCP/3389 (RDP) with repeated failed logins.
SOC takeaway: Repeated auth failures or unexpected SMB/RDP sessions suggest lateral-movement or brute-force attempts.

DNS noisy / exfil simulation
Example: Host queries a1b2c3d4e5.leak.example.com, x9k8j7... .leak.example.com many times with long/random labels.
SOC takeaway: Long/random subdomains and high-frequency DNS queries to rare domains = suspicious (possible exfiltration/beaconing).
