RDP Internal Access Lab

Steps completed so far:

Set up Kali VM and Windows 10 VM with bridged network.

Verified that both VMs are pingable.

On Windows 10 VM, enabled RDP via sysdm.cpl → Remote.

Noted the Windows 10 VM IP for RDP connection.

On Kali, used xfreerdp /v:<Windows_IP> to connect to Windows 10 VM.

Verified that the RDP session opens (black screen initially, then desktop appears).

Next steps with Wireshark:

Open Wireshark on Kali (or Windows host).

Select the network interface connected to the bridged network.

Set display/capture filters:

tcp.port == 445 → SMB

tcp.port == 3389 → RDP

Start capturing traffic before initiating RDP or any SMB activity.

Perform your RDP session and any SMB testing.

Save PCAPs and annotate key packets (RDP handshake, SMB negotiation)
