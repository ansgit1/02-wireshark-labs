SMB Lab Capture 

Purpose:
This lab demonstrates SMB (Server Message Block) communication between two Windows 10 guest machines. The goal is to observe SMB traffic, including file access and authentication as a SOC analyst perspective.

Setup:
- Two Windows 10 virtual machines (guests) in VMware, bridged network.
- Host machine: Windows 11, used for packet capture.
- SMB share created on one guest; files accessed/edited from the other guest.
- Network traffic captured on the host using Wireshark.

Tools Used:
- Wireshark (on Win11 host)
- Windows 10 guests (VMware)

Display filters  

 tcp.port == 445   shows SMB traffic by port 
 smb || smb2      to see smb2 traffic 


Observations:
- Tracked file creation and write operations across the SMB share.
- Observed NTLM authentication exchanges (`NTLMSSP`) during session setup.
- No lateral movement was performed â€” this was normal file share access between two guests.

Notes:
- If SMB3 encryption is enabled, filenames/contents may be opaque; rely on metadata (IPs, auths, volume).
- Useful quick filters: `frame contains "NTLMSSP"`, `smb2 && (smb2.cmd == 5 || smb2.cmd == 9)`
