Objective: Observe network scanning behavior (SYN packets, RST responses).

Setup / Tools:

Attacker: Kali VM â†’ nmap -sS 192.168.8.100

Target: Win11 host running Wireshark

What we did:

Started Wireshark on Win11.

Ran nmap -sS from Kali to Win11.

Captured SYN packets, SYN-ACKs (open ports), and RSTs (closed ports).

Saved capture (.pcapng), terminal output, screenshots, and notes.

Key Observation:

SYN scan generates traffic to multiple ports.

Open ports respond with SYN-ACK.

Closed ports respond with RST.
